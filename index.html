Welcome to my humble corner of the World Wide Web. My name is Brian Hudson.
</p>
<p>
I am a student at Grand Circus in Detroit, a game developer, and a writer. I am currently working on a video 
game called Unto the Breach, which is a retro-style RPG with modern gaming elements. I have also written a
novel, a novella, and numerous short stories set in the same world. All my work is done under the studio name of Templar Games, which is named in honor of my favorite band, HammerFall. After I complete Unto the Breach, I have plans for several more video games set in the same universe, including a first-person shooter, a twin-stick shooter, a visual novel, and an online RPG. You can see more information about my game and writing projects by clicking on the Portfolio link at the top or bottom of this page.
</p>
<p>
I also participate in the Warhammer hobby, a series of tabletop games using miniature models I build and paint myself, plus writing my own lore for my own custom factions within the settings. These games range in scale from skirmish-level that use only a handful of models and a small board, to warzone-level battles that can fill entire tables. There are both fantasy and science-fiction versions. I have been playing for almost 17 years, and organize numerous events throughout the year at my local game store. Although essentially retired now, I used to also compete regularly in national-level tournaments.
</p>
<p>
Currently I am studying to program in Java. I hope to be able to use the skills I learn to aid me in my game development work, although Unto the Breach utilizes an engine which uses Javascript. Still, a lot of the core principles are the same, right? It's tough sometimes with how long we're in class every day and how much work we have to do, but we have a good instructor and I think I'm doing well. It's hard to stay focused sometimes because the world is always so exciting and waiting to be explored. And my butt gets sore really easily.

Otherwise, sit back and enjoy the ride.
