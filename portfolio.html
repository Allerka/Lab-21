These are some of the gaming and writing projects I've done. Click on each title to be taken to a product page.

<h1><a href="https://allerka.itch.io/breach">Unto the Breach</a></h1>
<p>
My main game project, and easily the most ambitious thing I've ever done in my life. Mostly because I decided to do an entire team's-worth of work by myself. Turns out that takes a really frigging long time. Starting over from scratch four times doesn't help either. Episode One should take about 8-10 hours to complete. Assuming similar levels of content, that means the full game (at nine episodes) will be 60-100 hours, depending on player speed/skill/completion. I just need to actually get it done.
</p>
<h1><a href="https://www.templargames.com/projects/unto-the-breach-the-tournament">Unto the Breach: The Tournament</a></h1>
<p>
My first public video game release, and a prequel/spin-off to Unto the Breach. The Tournament follows Mileena Leguin as she arrives in Varennes, capital of Saniel, eager for adventure. Learning the annual De Tournie is taking place the very next day, she decides to enter. What's the worst that can happen?
<br>
The Tournament takes approximately an hour to complete.
</p>
<br>
<h1><a href="https://www.templargames.com/projects/murder-in-the-rue-marche">Murder in the Rue Marche</a></h1>
<p>
A prequel/spin-off to the prequel/spin-off, Murder in the Rue Marche takes place the day before The Tournament, and is a murder mystery game, with a different culprit each time a new game is started. Completed in about a week for a game contest, Murder takes approximately 45 minutes to complete a single playthrough.
</p>
<br>
<h1><a href="https://www.templargames.com/projects/unto-the-breach-episode-zero">Unto the Breach - Episode Zero</a></h1>
<p>
A direct introduction/prequel to Unto the Breach, Episode Zero introduces the main character, Alex, and follows him during what starts off as an uneventful day in his hometown of Montblanc, but ultimately serves as the catalyst that sends him out into the world. This was my first commercial release, and has many of the gameplay elements found in the full game. It takes approximately 2-3 hours to complete.
</p>
<br>
<h1><a href="https://www.templargames.com/projects/unto-the-breach-the-gathering">Unto the Breach: The Gathering</a></h1>
<p>
Taking place between Episode Zero and Episode One, The Gathering is a novella telling the story of how Alex and Conrad arrive in the city of Jorandek, and ultimately meet Lucy and Ali, who join them on their adventures leading into Episode One. Eventually I want to do a "second edition" to add several short stories and turn it into an anthology. But writing is haaaaard.

<h1><a href="https://www.templargames.com/projects/quantum-ryder">Quantum Ryder</a></h1>
<p>
Created for a two-day game jam, Quantum Ryder is a VGA-esque racing game. Lionel Ryder, a secret agent equipped with an experimental motor bike, is thrown through time by the ancient cyber-wizard Xygomek, and must now race to collect enough tachyon batteries to get back before it's too late! Can you tell I did the writing? I also managed the project, did some supplemental coding, and other work.
