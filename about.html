<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Born in Dearborn, I moved to Northville in 1993 and graduated high school in 2003. I joined the Army later that year. My first two years were in Korea, stationed at Camp Red Cloud, a small camp about the size of a Wal-Mart parking lot. While everyone else was out drinking and getting in trouble, I mostly spent my free time painting Warhammer models and playing World of Warcraft.
</p>
<p>
Only a few months after I got back from Korea, I was deployed to Iraq, where I did PC repair at the US Embassy in Baghdad. It was really frigging hot out there. We got mortared a lot. Once that 15-month tour was done, I came back and outprocessed from the Army.
</p>
<p>
I wasted no time in starting college, initially going to a place called Full Sail University in Florida, and then coming back to Michigan to graduate from Grand Valley State University with a degree in Creative Writing. I landed an internship at Quicken Loans immediately after graduation, but was laid off three months later.
</p>
<p>
I attended Grand Circus for the first time, going through a QA Testing bootcamp, and getting a job at OnStar the same day I graduated, only to again be laid off three months later. After that, I spent 2 1/2 years doing food service at the Ann Arbor VA Medical Facility. Bit of a departure from IT work, but it turned out I was really frigging good at it. I also got certified in Mixology (not for work though).
</p>
<p>
Some other things happened between those, but this covers the big stuff. Mostly. Or just partially. Or even only incrementally. I didn't even talk about all my international and interstate traveling. Or my relationships. I met John Romero once. He's a cool guy.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, now I'm back at Grand Circus again learning Java. And probably having way too much fun with this particular assignment. Have another GIF!
